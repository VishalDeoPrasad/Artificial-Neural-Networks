# Introduction to Neural Network

## What is Deep Learning?
- Deep Learning is basically a field of study where in we use something known as neurons for traing the data.
- for example, we teach a baby how to identify the cat or dog or car.
- Automated Feature Engineering.
- In Machine Learning need data in feature space such as x1, x2, x3... 
- Where as Deep Learning No need of Featurization.
- Deep Learning can Extract the feature from Image, Text, Tabula data, Audio, Video, etc. it automatically extract information.
- **New Definition:** Deep Learning is basically a mathematical techinique that enable us to extract infromation from any kind of structured/unstructured data using the concept of neuron.
